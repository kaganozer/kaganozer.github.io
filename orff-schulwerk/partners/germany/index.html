            <strong>Alfred Nobel School</strong> is a conveniently located European school in the middle of Britz's green Neukölln district, with a distinctive cultural profile and a great commitment to students. Our primary goal is to provide our students with the best opportunities to prepare on their way to high school, in addition to a variety of cultural projects.We have 509 students and total 65 instructors and employees in our school. There are 3 sports halls, a simulator room, a theater hall, a music room, and an activity room to be used in different activities.The Alfred Nobel School, together with the neighboring Albert Einstein High School, is part of the special offer of the Berlin School of the State of Berlin European School (SESB). This type of school is especially recommended for children whose parents value learning two languages equally.7-10th of the Alfred Nobel School, each of their classes has one SESB class. Our common language is Italian. The concept of the school is bilingual and bicultural.In our school, teachers from Italy and Germany design the lessons in such a way that the cultures of the two countries can come together and at the same time preserve the cultural identity. It is very important for us to prepare our students well for their future lives, so life path planning and comprehensive career orientation are made for our students at our school.It is important to develop cultural awareness and competencies of our students in this field. For this reason, many activities are organized.Together with teachers and artists,students work on projects such as festivals where different cultural traditions and lifestyles can flow together.Practically every student is now involved in at least one project in promoting cultural education in our school. Creating awareness of individual and cultural differences is an issue that we care about and therefore our Orff-Schulwerk for Inclusion project is important for us.
            <br><br>
            Our students are from 12 to 16 years old, from many different cultural backgrounds. The Alfred Nobel School is especially recommended for children whose parents value learning two languages equally.Students are supprted to take a place in projects and they are used to take active roles during activities.So in this project, they will learn to tolerate other students with special needs and gifts. They will learn to work for inclusion.On the other hand they are open to use new methods in learning environments , while they are taking active role ,they will have new point of views to different methods in different cultures.
