Our school is especially made up of students whose parents give value of learning two languages equally. The students of our partner schools are disadvantaged individuals who are disabled and gifted, as well as children of middle and low socio-economic level families. All these aspects are designed to serve the inclusion goal of our project. The inclusiveness aspect of the project was targeted as the students of all partners consist of different
                characteristics. This project, in which Normal-Special Education-Gifted students will be brought together, will serve the process of understanding and accepting each other.Uniting around the principle of inclusiveness, students will support respect for different qualities and abilities and support working together. In addition to these, our target audience is all the people who can be reached by local and national institutions and organizations, local and national media on the basis of all participants. Although our students, who will be active participants in the project, are between the ages of 13 and 16, indirectly, students from all age groups will participate in our project. The open source availability of the outputs of our
                project will strengthen the disseminating effect of our project results.

                <h1>Why Orff-Schulwerk for Inclusion?</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="parallax-content">As a result of the meetings held by all the teachers of our school under the leadership of our Strategic Project Team, the effectiveness and importance of art activities for a youth embracing all segments of the society and embracing an inclusive culture was emphasized and it was decided to produce projects to bring students with different characteristics together through art activities. As one of the most effective tools for self-awareness, development of a sense of self-worth, communication with peers and inclusion in society, it is agreed that basic music activities are the main axis of our project.The Orff-Schulwerk Music Approach, which we arrived at based on this, is the basic music and movement education approach developed by Carl Orff (1895-1982), a German composer and music educator. Orff-Schulwerk is an effective music education that gives place to all individuals in line with their abilities and thus provides a musical environment in which every individual can be involved. The Orff approach is based on the idea that each individual has a
                unique ability, and is based on the natural behavior of individuals in their own unique way and using their whole body. The basic music studies in Orff are independent of any age, special abilities and special needs with the feature of being applications where everyone can make music actively and creatively, and they are carried out as group musical activities in which each individual participates in line with their individual competencies. The studies carried out with the Orff approach enable people with different abilities and disabilities to meet in a common life with its integration feature. In our project, our target audience is students from all segments of the society and who have differences, based on the students who are between the ages of 13-16, who are normally developing, who need special education and who are gifted. The main goal of our project is that the Orff-Schulwerk approach, which is actively applied as a part of integrative education in many countries of Europe, contributes to the social integration and harmony environment through the recognition and experience of our European students and colleagues under the guidance of their knowledge and experience. Considering how limited the communication environments that enable people with different abilities and disabilities to meet in a common life in our society, the Orff-Schulwerk approach will give us a great experience and help to overcome an existing deficiency.
                <br><br>
                The main goal of the activities we plan to achieve the goals of our project is to meet our students with peers who need special education and are identified as gifted. Social inclusion / integration and realization through the activities they will take part in and increase social dialogue. For this reason, online meetings have been planned for learning-teaching activities and planning for active implementation process. With TPM, our teachers will meet with their colleagues in our partner countries, they will exchange information, establish professional communication networks, and increase their professional and cultural awareness by getting to know their colleagues from different cultures and languages, as well as learning the Orff Schulwerk Approach. With learning-teaching activities; Our students will meet with their peers who need
                special education and are gifted from participating countries, and they will find the opportunity to express themselves in different environments and languages as well as social integration. The development of self-confidence, recognition of different languages and cultures and gaining awareness are the main objectives of these activities. In addition, the events and meetings we will organize will enable us to increase the self-confidence by exhibiting the activities of our students and participating teachers, the development of self-expression skills in society, as well as to increase awareness of the use of the Orff approach in the field of integration for individuals who need special education, and to try and discover new methods and ideas for all participants. their awareness towards them will also be increased. In addition to all these, the way they match up with our activities and goals in the Orff-Schulwerk music approach, which we think will contribute to social inclusion / integration, is as follows: Sound making games with rhythm: To obtain language and speaking skills, ability to express oneself with music Performing traditional nursery rhymes and songs with simple music and rhythm instruments: Developing language and speaking skills, expressing themselves with music Verbal, non-verbal and danceassisted rhythm exercises: to develop self-awareness and communication skills with peers, to develop a sense of selfworth, willingness to experiment and explore, to develop speaking skills, to feel safe and to be included in the community development of skills Musical games: To obtain communication skills with peers, ability to be a part of a whole, cooperation and division of labor Creating sounds and melodies accompanying stories and vocalizing with simple musical instruments: Language and speaking skills, expanding perception and expressing oneself with music skills,
                experimentation and discovery, communication skills with peers, being a part of a whole, ability to cooperate and divide labor, social adaptation.
                <br><br>
                Our project has been set out with the aim of meeting our students with disadvantaged peers for a happier, more active and more inclusive society and European citizenship.A tendency to different languages and cultures is the common characteristic of our students, and we aim to support our students' openness to differences with their disabled and talented peers. Hence, sensitivity to cultural and linguistic differences as well as sensitivity to individual differences are within the scope of our project.The most viable way to achieve these goals is to cooperate with transnational partners and to host different individuals and cultures as well as guests in different cultures.Orff-Schulwerk basic music activities that can appeal to every level of abilities and individual characteristics are an effective way to get to know each other and increase their awareness of their differences, through bringing together these very different peer groups, activities to be
                carried out together.As a universal language, we want to prepare our project target groups for a more inclusive, more egalitarian, happier and more tolerant future with the healing and unifying power of music.We hope that all of our students who take part in the project will be part of a better future with the sharing and exchanging of good practices in different cultures and environments.Our project will have the opportunity to appeal to a much wider audience, and the sustainability and permanence of our project will be ensured with the task sharing with our transnational partners and effective dissemination activities to be carried out in line with these duties. We believe that it is a very important experience for our students to experience differences locally. In addition, hosting disadvantaged individuals from different cultures in our country will create new perspectives in their lives, and will enable them to develop tolerance and belonging
                to each other.
